    <h2>Or rant about whatever grinds your gears</h2>

    <h4>I mean, like what is his deal?</h4>

        <div>This exercise is about nesting div tags
            <div>This div contains this text and the div tag below.
                <div>Hi, I'm the div tag that was mentioned in my parent div! I contain this text and two other children divs
                    <div>Hi! Our parent was just talking about us. Please make sure you indent this example appropriately.
                        <div>Hi! Our parent was just talking about us. Please make sure you indent this example appropriately.</div>

    This exercise is about making lists

Here's what I like about lists:
<ul>
    <li>They're useful for displaying lists of stuff</li>
    <li>That's about it</li>
    <li>I'm gunna put another list item here because doing things in threes is cool</li>
</ul>

When you make a list, do it in this order:
<ol>
    <li>Decide if it's an ordered list or not</li>
    <li>If it's not an ordered list, use the ul tag, otherwise use the ol tag</li>
        <ul><li>Use li tags nested in the list for your list items</li></ul>
           <ol><li>Curveball! You can nest lists inside each other</li></ol>
    <li>You've got this, I believe in you!
</ol>
